# Star-Quarries-Code
This is all of the code for my first ever game, Star Quarries. I love this project sincerely, and spent easily 2000+ hours developing this game. I learned so much from this project, what to do, and maybe even moreso what not to do.

I completely recognize and understand that there are so many better methods, resources, and approaches I could have taken to this project, and that is why I am so grateful to be able to share it here. In this code, I will outline what to do, and what not to do to the best of my ability. What different resources could have been used, and what I would do when creating this project again.

Thank you for reading this, hope you enjoy!
